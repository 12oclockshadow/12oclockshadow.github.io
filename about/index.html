He balances parenting, girl friends, and a music career on a knife edge while he explores the Seattle music scene.  He just missed being named Kenmore Jazz Musician of the Year, but, with continuing fortitude, continues to hone his skills searching for those perfect musical arrangements that make 12 O’Clock Shadow a study in variety, swing, and eclectic styles.</p>

                        <p>Cameron Davison is shrouded in mystery. Rumor says he was either born in Bellevue, or at a mental hospital in Hell. His childhood was fraught with danger on the hard, hard streets of suburban Issaquah, where he fell into bad company as a numbers runner for the Scottish Mafia. His early forays into organized crime were cut short when he took a bullet to the knee, and he then focused his efforts into playing the Alto Sax . Now he spends his time directing the Pacific Cascade Big Band, playing in the 12 O'Clock Shadows and moonlighting in the evenings as a crime fighting superhero on the hard, hard streets of suburban North Seattle.</p>

                        <p>It had been quite a while since Bob sang in high school or studied voice in college, but a few years ago, Jim Borthen (bari saxophone), convinced Bob that singing jazz and the blues should be his next big adventure.   Bob took his advice, continues to hone his vocal skills, and looks forward to exploring the edgier side of the American Songbook with 12 O’Clock Shadow.</p>

                        <p>Dave’s an expat Canuck, living in Seattle long enough to have learned a thousand words for rain.   Software lured him to West, but that doesn’t seem to matter anymore compared to the challenges of being a youth sports Dad!  Dave channeled Hendrix in the 70s, Gilmour in the  80s and Navarro in the 90s but now that he’s all grown up he doesn’t sound like any of those guys.  He’s super excited to being a part of 12 O’Clock Shadow and bringing soulful swing and blues sounds to the people.   He can also be found around Seattle with his other band, TrebleMaker.</p>
